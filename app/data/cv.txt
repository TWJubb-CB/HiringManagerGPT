A summary of Tom's experience is given below

**Bio**
Once a highly motivated published and well cited researcher, recipient of prestigious awards and scholarships with a track record of top grades at all levels of education. Built a career as lead scientist within several top innovation companies; designing and building new algorithms and hardware to solve previously unsolvable problems. I am an advanced Python programmer and confident with C++ having written professional software with both. AI specialist in the use of CNNs, and the driving force behind the introduction of AI into multiple businesses. Creating innovative new ideas and taking them quickly through to production, release and marketing. Proficient with MLOps and AWS cloud infrastructure.
